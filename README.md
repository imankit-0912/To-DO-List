# To-Do-List
Description: Develop a basic To-Do List application using HTML, CSS for the front end, and JavaScript for functionality. The to-do list should allow users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks.

# Steps to follow:

1. Design Essential Components
-  Input Field: A text input field for users to add new tasks. 
- Add Button: A button to add the task to the list. 
- Task List: A section to display the list of tasks. 
- Task Item: Each task item should include the task text, a complete button, and a delete button.

2.  Layout and Styling: Use CSS to style the to-do list application. Arrange the components in a user-friendly layout.
 
3. JavaScript Functionality: Implement event listeners for adding, completing, and deleting tasks. Write functions to handle task addition, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks.

4. Testing: Test the to-do listâ€™s basic functionality. Ensure all buttons work correctly and tasks can be added, marked as complete, and deleted.
